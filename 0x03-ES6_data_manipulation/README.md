ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several features that make data manipulation in JavaScript more convenient and expressive. These features include enhancements to array manipulation, template literals, and the introduction of new data structures like sets and maps.
Template Literals: Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside string literals using ${}. This is particularly useful when creating strings that involve variables or expressions.
Destructuring: Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.
Sets and Maps: ES6 introduced two new data structures, Set and Map, which are useful for unique collections of values and key-value mappings, respectively.
